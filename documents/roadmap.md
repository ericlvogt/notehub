# Road Map
Make it work, Make it right, Make it fast

1. Develop user stories
1. Develop Prototype
1. Update user stories
1. Review backbone technologies
2. Minimum viable product
2. Alpha testing

Taking an agile mindset to planning out development it is unproductive to exhaustively plan out every feature and technology used. To prove out the concept and allow time for course correction a prototype will be developed using the proposed technology stack. Development should focus on delivery of initial user stories to "Make it work".
