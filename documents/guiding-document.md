# Guiding Document
The main objectives of this product:
1. Share notes taken for a specific class or purpose
2. Easily find notes shared by others based on the class or purpose of their study
3. Allow users to access notes from anywhere

## Features

Features shall be documented as user stories on GitHub.

Some early ideas are:

### User Base
Users should be able to log into the application to be able to personalize their experience on the platform. For instance users should be able to have liked note topics, notes, be able to own authorship of the notes they write, and personalize their UX.

### Easy Access
Allow users to easily access notes from anywhere and any machine. Users should be able to work offline on notes and merge notes with the stored version once complete.

### Not a Text Editor
This application will not serve as a text editor the main intent is to make it easy to share and look up notes not to serve as an editor. Similar to GitHub it may be convenient to allow users to edit uploaded notes in case there are small corrections to be made. To make this convenient it may be necessary to allow for in application editing.

### Version Control
Ideally notes should be able to be stored under version control to keep history of changes and ease to rollback unwanted modifications.

## Challenges

### Note Formats
A challenge for this application will be what formats will be supported and how will they be stored. Notes are taken across many different available applications and formats from written on paper, Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft OneNote, Google Docs, Notion, LaTeX etc. Additionally many subjects require mathematical notation, drawings, and graphs.

Some possible solutions to handling this include allowing users to upload photographs or scanned copies of written notes.

## Artificial Intelligence Integration
If many notes are uploaded for the same course or study AI could propose a consolidated version of notes with all the most important information for a specific topic or lecture.

## Token Economy
Could utilize tokens to reward users with notes viewed or liked.
